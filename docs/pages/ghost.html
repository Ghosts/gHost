        <h2>gHost</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>gHost follows a simple format to ensure fast deployment and a small learning curve. A primary goal of gHost is to offer a streamlined
        setup process for beginners, while allowing additional modifications and additions as needed. To launch a gHost server, you may simply
        run the Runner.Java file without arguments. However, to allow a greater flexibility Runner.Java also allows you to pass the following
        parameter schemes:</p>
        <pre>
        Runner.Java [Port] [Root Directory Path]<br/>
        Runner.Java [Port] [Root Directory Path] [Resources Path]<br/>
        Runner.Java [Port] [Root Directory Path] [Resources Path] [Pages Subdirectory]
        </pre>
        <p>
            By default, gHost will use port 80 and locate the default gHost server page + resources directory in order to serve files.
            You may begin using gHost by following the default file directory schema and simply adding .html, .css, .js, and images within
            their default folder structures. The directory settings within Runner.Java allow greater flexibility and real-time testing.
            It is not advisable to use passed arguments to setup directory paths, and is rather offered as a feature to quickly switch directories
            and run separate instances of gHost via command line. All routes, directories, variables, and settings should be set within the Runner.Java file.

        </p>
        <h2>Runner.Java</h2>
        <p>Runner.Java has been referenced multiple times but it may not be immediately clear what this class is intended for. Although all gHost code
        can be viewed in their respective classes, Runner.Java drives each component and controls the settings & setup of gHost itself. Any settings
        or required setup calls in order to run gHost are controlled within the Runner.Java class.</p>
